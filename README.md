# Generative Midi Files for Electronic Composition

---

This repository uses `pycomposer` and midi files from the [MIDM Database](http://midm-database.co.uk/) to generate MIDI tracks from input files using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks.

This is a fun project to play around a bit more with python coding.

The required libraries to run the Jupyter notebook in the repository are: `mxnet`, `pycomposer`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
